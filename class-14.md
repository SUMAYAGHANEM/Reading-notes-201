# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team:

nstead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams: Psychological safety:
Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won't be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time

Our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of.
Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves
to studying everything from team composition to email patterns!

in order to **figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves**

**roject Aristotle’s researchers** began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked:
* Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests?
* Or did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? 
* Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized
* the composition of groups inside Google: How often did teammates socialize outside the office? 
* Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar
*No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns — or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference.*

**researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.**
efficent team :  
* professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert
* and then they speak at length,
*  explaining what the group ought to do.
*   When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track

**conclusion**
We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference.
The ‘‘who’’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter.’

**‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’**
The technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; 
it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture. And at the core of Silicon Valley are certain self-mythologies and dictums:
Everything is different now, data reigns supreme, 
today’s winners deserve to triumph because they are cleareyed enough to discard yesterday’s conventional wisdoms and search out the disruptive and the new.

when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional 
interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really
be optimized. Rozovsky herself was reminded of this midway through her work with the Project Aristotle team. ‘‘We were in a meeting where
I made a mistake,’’ Rozovsky told me. She sent out a note afterward explaining how she was going to remedy the problem. 
‘‘I got an email back from a teammember that said, ‘Ouch,’ ’’ she recalled. ‘‘It was like a punch to the gut.
I was already upset about making this mistake, and this note totally played on my insecurities.’’
