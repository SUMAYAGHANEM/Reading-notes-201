  # CREATING AN ARRAY in JS : <P>
   The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type,  <P>     so you can store a string, a number and  a Boolean all in the same array <P>
   **numbers in arrays** Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index. This can be used to access specific items in the array. <P>
   *index values start at 0 (not 1)* <P>
   **ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY** the array name is specified along with the index number in square brackets.  <P>

* (&&) : if the two operateds are true then the result will be true,otherwise its false <P>
* (||) :  if the two operateds are true,or one of them is true then the result will be true,otherwise its false. <P>
