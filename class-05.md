# images in html : 
< img > : To add an image into the page you need to use an <img>element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the 
 following two attributes: <P>
  * src : This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. <P>
  * alt : This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.<P>
 ** the size of the image ** : <P>
  * height This specifies the height of the image in pixels.<P>
  * width  This specifies the width of the image in pixels.<P>
 align : The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image<P>
  * left This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side)<P>
  * right This aligns the image to the right (allowing text to flow around its left-hand side)<P>
 **Image Dimensions** The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.<P>
  
  **images resolution**<P>
  * Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent.<P>
  *  Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.<P>
 **Transparenc**<P>
 If the transparent part of the image has straight edges and it is 100% transparent (that is, not semi-opaque), you can save the image as a GIF (with the <P>
 transparency option selected)<P>
 
 **< figcaption >** The < figcaption > element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.<P>
# color :<P>
rgb: values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For <P>
hex codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # <P>

# jpg and png :<P>

PNG: is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. <P>
No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image.<P>
For this reason, a PNG image would retain higher quality than an image than JPEG and would look a lot sharper, <P>
it would also occupy more space on the disk. This makes it unsuitable for storing or transferring high-resolution digital photographs<P>
but a great choice for images with text, logos and shapes with sharp edges.<P>

JPEG: is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception. It can achieve compression ratios of 1:10 without any perceivable difference in quality.
