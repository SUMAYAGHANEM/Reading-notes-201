# Links in Html.
Links are created using the (a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing (/a> tag. <P>
**href**Links are created using the (a>element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.<P>
**Relative URLs** can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.<P>
**Email Links** To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a>element. However, <P>this time the value of the href attribute starts 
 with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.<P>
**Opening Links in a New Window**  <P>
  * If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening (a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.<P>**Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page** Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will go to. <P> You do 
 this using the id attribute 
  * To link to an element that uses an id attribute you use the (a> element again, but the value of the href attribute starts with the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute of the element you want to link to <P>

# functions in JS<P>
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function<P>
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().<P>
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).<P>
The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:<P>
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)<P>
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}<P>
**Function Invocation**<P>

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:<P>

* When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)<P>
* When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code<P>
* Automatically (self invoked)<P>
