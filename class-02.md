# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS<P>
  ## Html intr.
* **Headings:**<P>
 HTML has six "levels" of headings:<P>
(h1) is used for main headings<P>
* **Paragraphs**:<P>
  To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag.<P>
* **Bold & Italic**<P>
  (b)By enclosing words in the tags (b> and </b) we can make characters appear bold.<P>
  (I)By enclosing words in the tags (i> and </i) we can make characters appear italic. <P>
* **line break**
  As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can 
  use the line break tag (br /> <P>
* **(strong>** The use of the (strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. <P>
* **(blockquote>** The <blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Note how the (p> element is still used inside the (blockquote> element.<P>
* **(ins> (del>** : The (ins> element can be used  to show content that has been  inserted into a document, while the (del> element can show text that has been deleted from it.

  ### visual editors :<P>
  Visual editors often resemble word processors. Although each editor will differ slightly, there are some features that are common to most editors that allow you to control the 
   presentation of text<P>
  
  ## css intro .
css is designing program to make the html paage look good with colors, fonts,borders and different elemants.
CSS allows you to create rules that control theway that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.
### a csss rule contain 2 parts :
* selector
* decleration
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon.
* you can include the css file inside html using the link , ( work on css in external file then link it inside html )
* You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element

## color:
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
* rgb values
* hex codes
* color names

**background-color**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background.
*When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible*

# javascript :
Each version of a web browser adds new features,Often these new features make tasks easier, and better, than using older techniques. 

### the basics:
Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful.
* **examples**
* Access the content of the page
* Modify the content of the page
* Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
* React to events triggered by the user or browser 
* 
**What is a script and how do I create one?**

![script](https://akwade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/put-code-js-in-body.png)

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
WRITING A SCRIPT:
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. Start with the big picture of whatyou want to achieve, and breakthat down into smaller steps. 1: DEFINE THE GOAL 2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT 3: CODE EACH STEP
EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value.
* Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
 * EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign). var color = ‘beige’;
 * EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE individual values (see next page) to determine a single value. For example: var area = 3 * 2.

## comparision operators :
to compare the value in the script with what is expected .
* (==) : the value equals to .
* (!=) : not eqal to.
* (===) :strict equal to ( in value and type )
* (<,>) : greater or less than to compare the numbers.
## logical operators :
* (&&) : if the two operateds are true then the result will be true,otherwise its false
* (||) :  if the two operateds are true,or one of them is true then the result will be true,otherwise its false.
* (!) : not , the opposite.

# loops : 
1- for loop : when you know the number of times you want to run the loop.
2-while loop : use it when you want strings as anoutcome.
3-do-while loop : it will run the statement inside the curly brackets at least once.

## loop counters
