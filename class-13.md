#  LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS
1-In the beginning, there was only Internet Explorer,Microsoft invented a great many things and included them in their browser-to-end-all-browser-wars,
Internet Explorer. One of these things was called DHTML Behaviors, and one of these behaviors was called userData.

2-user data : allows web pages to store up to 64 KB of data per domain
3-In 2002, Adobe introduced a feature in Flash 6 that gained the unfortunate and misleading name of “Flash cookies.” Within the Flash environment,
the feature is properly known as Local Shared Objects. Briefly, it allows Flash objects to store up to 100 KB of data per domain

4-In the meantime, Brad Neuberg and others continued to hack away on dojox.storage to provide a unified interface to all these different plugins and APIs. By 2009, 
dojox.storage could auto-detect (and provide a unified interface on top of) Adobe Flash, Gears, Adobe AIR, and an early prototype of HTML5
storage that was only implemented in older versions of Firefox.
