# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables
### Tables

definition : A table represents information in a grid format
importance : Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.
elemets : 
* < table > : is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row. 
* < tr > : opening tag to indicate the start of each row 
* < td > : The td stands for table data.
* < th > : table heading .

Spanning ColumnS :  The colspan attribute can be used on a < th> or < td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.

**Long Tables :**
There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows:
* < thead>
* < tbody>
* < tfoot>
Border & Background : The border attribute was used on both the <table> and <td>elements to indicate the width of the border in pixels.


# Functions, Methods, and Objects
In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

* bBooleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Dates are always objects
* Maths are always objects
* Regular expressions are always objects
* Arrays are always objects
* Functions are always objects
* Objects are always objects
**Using an Object Literal**
Using an object literal, you both define and create an object in one statement.

An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.

**ADDING AND REMOVING PROPERTIES**
You do this using the dot notation , To delete a property, you use the keyword delete, and then use dot notation to identify the property or method you want to 
remove from the object.
*The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers 
to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.*
A FUNCTION IN GLOBAL SCOPE : When a function is created at the top level of a script then its global function scope 
STORING DATA : In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. \
To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of 
related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key. 

**WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS? :**
Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the 
browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These 
built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.

GLOBAL OBJECTS: STRING O BJECT : Whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties 
and methods of the String object on that value

1. String 
2. Number 
3. Boolean
