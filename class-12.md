# charts in js : 

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool.
Setting up

* The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js
* Drawing a line chart :To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart
* Next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element:
* Inside the same script tags we need to create our data

**Drawing a pie chart**
* we need the canvas element
* Next, we need to get the context and to instantiate the chart
* Next we need to create the data.

**Drawing a bar chart**
* we add the canvas element
* we retrieve the element and create the graph
* we add in the bar chartâ€™s data

# Applying styles and colors

 we will explore the canvas options we have at our disposal to make our drawings a little more attractive
 **Colors :**
 there are two important properties we can use: 
 * fillStyle :Sets the style used when filling shapes.
 * strokeStyle : Sets the style for shapes' outlines.
  
  example code :
  function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  for (var i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
      ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(' + Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * i) + ', ' +
                       Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * j) + ', 0)';
      ctx.fillRect(j * 25, i * 25, 25, 25);
    }
  }
}

-**Transparency**
 This is done by either setting the globalAlpha property or by assigning a semi-transparent color to the stroke and/or fill style.
 
 **Line styles**
There are several properties which allow us to style lines.

lineWidth = value
Sets the width of lines drawn in the future.
lineCap = type
Sets the appearance of the ends of lines.
lineJoin = type
Sets the appearance of the "corners" where lines meet.
miterLimit = value
Establishes a limit on the miter when two lines join at a sharp angle, to let you control how thick the junction becomes.
getLineDash()
Returns the current line dash pattern array containing an even number of non-negative numbers.
setLineDash(segments)
Sets the current line dash pattern.
lineDashOffset = value
Specifies where to start a dash array on a line.

# Basic usage of canvas
t first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.
 *It is always a good idea to supply an id because this makes it much easier to identify it in a script.*
 
 **Fallback content**
 it is easy to define some fallback content :
 : just insert the alternate content inside the <canvas> element. Browsers that don't support <canvas> will ignore the container and render the fallback content inside it. Browsers that do support <canvas> will ignore the content inside the container, and just render the canvas normally.
